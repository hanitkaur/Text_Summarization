# Text Summarization using NLP

## Introduction

Text summarization is the process of automatically condensing a large amount of text into a shorter, coherent version while retaining the most important information. This repository contains code and resources for implementing text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Whether you want to generate extractive summaries (selecting important sentences) or abstractive summaries (generating new sentences), this project provides a foundation for building your text summarization system.

## Usage

This section provides an overview of how to use the text summarization code provided in this repository:

- Preprocessing: Preprocess your text data by tokenizing, cleaning, and formatting it appropriately.

- Select a Summarization Technique: Choose between extractive or abstractive summarization methods based on your requirements. Extractive methods select sentences from the input text, while abstractive methods generate new sentences.

-Implement Summarization Algorithm: Depending on your choice of technique, implement the algorithm. Commonly used techniques include TF-IDF, TextRank, Gensim's LDA, Seq2Seq, or Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2).

-Evaluate: Use evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR to assess the quality of your summaries. See the Evaluation section for more details.

- Fine-Tuning (Optional): If you are using deep learning-based approaches, consider fine-tuning on your specific dataset to improve summarization performance.

## Smmarization Techniques
There are two main categories of summarization techniques:

-Extractive Summarization: Selects important sentences or phrases from the input text.

-Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the input text.
